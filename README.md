=================
this is a poorly made new tab/home page that I made using the css from my website ([pogonip.pw](pogonip.pw))  
it's relatively easy to edit, just change the span label and the stuff in the div and it should work (I hope)  
there's also a "manifest.json" file incase you want to use it as a chrome new tab page, just load the folder as an extension and it should work (I hope)  
  
dependencies
------------
I didn't package any of the dependencies because I'm not sure if I should  
they are all linked on some sort of cdn though  
here's a list:
+ hover - [http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
+ jquery - [http://jquery.com/download/](http://jquery.com/download/)
+ fontawesome - [https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)  

setup
-----
it's pretty self-explanatory, but with dependencies in mind, either stick with the cdn, or if you want an entirely offline setup you can download them  

+ for hover, you just need to put "hover.css" into the "css" folder
+ for jquery, basically the samething but put it in the "js" folder and make sure the file names match up
+ and for fontawesome, follow the directions on their site for setup  

also shoutout to this guy for the clock.js: [http://www.alessioatzeni.com/blog/css3-digital-clock-with-jquery/](http://www.alessioatzeni.com/blog/css3-digital-clock-with-jquery/)
