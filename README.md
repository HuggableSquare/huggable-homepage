huggable-homepage
=================
this is a poorly made (less and less with each commit) new tab/home page that I made using the css from my website ([pogonip.pw](http://pogonip.pw/))  
btw, the clock/calendar/link buttons in the bottom left toggle the clock/date/links, respectively  
and, clicking on the actual clock will switch between 12 and 24 hour modes  
  
dependencies
------------
the dependencies are managed using `yarn`  
here's a list of them:
+ fontawesome - [http://fontawesome.io/](http://fontawesome.io/)  

the hover effect is from [hover.css](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover)  
also shoutout to this guy for the clock.js base: [http://www.alessioatzeni.com/blog/css3-digital-clock-with-jquery/](http://www.alessioatzeni.com/blog/css3-digital-clock-with-jquery/)  

setup
-----
step 1. clone the repo  
step 2. `yarn && yarn run build`  
step 3. ???  
step 4. profit

also, since chrome doesn't support custom new tab pages, you can load the folder as an extension (hence the manifest.json) or you can download some other extension that does the same thing (entirely up to you)
